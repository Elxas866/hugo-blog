# hugo-blog
This is a blog project that reads Markdown files and converts them to HTML using
[Hugo ðŸ”¥](https://gohugo.io/)

## Benefits
### Hosting cost
Using this approach I am able to minimize hosting costs as far as possible, since
only HTML files are served and I don't require a database.
### Theming
Hugo enables theming and many skilled designers have published their cool themes
which can easily be imported and used. So, no more centering divs myself :)

## Can I help?
Yes, you can. If you are familiar with Hugo and spot a flaw in my config files or
just have a better approach, pls contact me via the contact section at my portfolio
