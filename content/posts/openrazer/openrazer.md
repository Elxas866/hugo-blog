## What is OpenRazer?
I recently acquired a new Razer mouse (Basilisk V3 X Hyperspeed) and wanted to modify it on Linux as well. That's when I found [OpenRazer](https://openrazer.github.io/). It is a community-led effort to support Razer peripherals on Linux. The driver supports hundreds of Razer devices, if not all of them.

## How to use it
I really love the Linux community 4 things like this. The driver works like a charm. You can install many different programs that integrate with the OpenRazer driver. I personally use [Polychromatic](https://polychromatic.app/) to control the DPI, RGB effects and basically every important setting I need.

## SecureBoot
As for many 3rd party drivers on Linux, the drivers won't be seen as safe by your systems BIOS per default. Luckily, OpenRazer have a tutorial regarding this here: https://github.com/openrazer/openrazer/wiki/Secure-Boot. Just follow the steps and it should work just fine:)
