I always wanted to develop a post where I could write inspiring stuff about my life and programming carrier. But the problem always was, that hosting a big ass web app with a database and everything would result in high hosting cost.
To avoid this, I came up with this solution:
- I write my posts in Markdown
- I translate the Markdown to HTML using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- I run a custom bash script to polish everything off
- I automatically publish the site to Vercel through a GitHub push
